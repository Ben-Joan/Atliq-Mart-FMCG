## Introduction
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the â€™On timeâ€™ and â€˜In Fullâ€™ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure â€˜on-time delivery (OT) %â€™, â€˜In-full delivery (IF) %â€™ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Strategy Implemented ðŸŽ¯ 
To perform this task, the process involved were:

1.Importing data as a CSV file and creating a data model from scratch to link the tables 

2. Using the appropriate data types and creating calculated columns to aid in providing more insights

3. Creating Measures & calculations using DAX to track requested metrics, like;

    a. DOT% - Delivery on Time
    
    b. DIF% - Delivery in Full
    
    c. OTIF% - On Time In Full
    
    d. Total orders and Total Orderlines
    
    e. LIFR% - Line Fill Rate
    
    f. VOFR% - Volume Fill Rate
    
    g. Delivery Days, etc
    
 4. Creating tooltips and visuals using appropriate charts to communicate findings
